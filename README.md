# XML-JSON-Parser
This project parse XML file to JSON object

Using C#, A project has been created to parse XML files into JSON.

The default file is Data.xml in the Debug folder but you can replace your own file instead of that and manipulate the necessary variable to match your requirements. For any confusion or query, create an issue so that I can solve it. Have fun!
